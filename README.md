#### Welcome :fox_face:
<p>I am currently working as a Post-Doc at the Institute for Virology in Freiburg leading the in-house NGS sequencing laboratory. We focus on viral genomics and intra-host evolution of diverse pathogens (Hepatitis E virus, SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, MPXV and HSV-1). I started bioinformatics at the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and have been in love with big data, genomics, metagenomics, coding and pyhlogenetics ever since. I am a super weird mixture of wet-lab molecular virologist, bioinformatician, data scientist, NGS specialist, epidemiologist, clinical scientist and nerd.</p>

#### Software :floppy_disk:

I am working on software for viral genomics. Available through `pip` (and `conda`).

- Aggregate your virus sequencing results into an interactive plot: [`BAMdash`](https://github.com/jonas-fuchs/BAMdash)
- Design primers for PCR on highly variable alignments: [`varVAMP`](https://github.com/jonas-fuchs/varVAMP)
- Compare vcf files as a heatmap: [`virHEAT`](https://github.com/jonas-fuchs/virHEAT)
